PyLight is a simple, neat and all rounder Python code editor. While other IDEs focus on features, PyLight is all about you and your Python codes! From great syntax highlighting to creating complex modules, PyLight has all the features that a developer needs but can't find in other Python IDEs!
Additionally, PyLight builds a base for the beginners by allowing them to access simple inbuilt codes and also search for any doubts that they have using the 'Search for help' function.
And as a cherry on the top, with PyLight you can save a Python file as .exe in just one click!
When you open PyLight you would need to specify the installation file path of Python. Once that is done, you can use the software freely. After installation press F1 for any help.
During the installation please read the terms & conditions carefully and don't skip the 'important notice'.

Giorgiana Arghire from Softpedia rates PyLight a 4.0/5.0 and says "PyLight can prove to be a handy solution for all Python enthusiasts who are looking for an intuitive solution for editing their code lines."
